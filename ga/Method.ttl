    skos:scopeNote "Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) is an analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in materials such as metals, pottery and glass. Although it is a destructive technique, the sample size needed is very small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram) and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately weighed and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomised (see schematic diagram). Light of a suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the element in the solution, and hence in the original object. Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts."@en ;

An ADCP can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface.  The ADCP measures water currents with sound, using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect. The ADCP works by transmitting \"pings\" of sound at a constant frequency into the water. As the sound waves travel, they ricochet off particles suspended in the moving water, and reflect back to the instrument. The difference in frequency between the waves the profiler sends out and the waves it receives is called the Doppler shift. The instrument uses this shift to calculate how fast the particle and the water around it are moving. www.whoi.edu/science/instruments/adcpv2.htm(.) www.nortekusa.com/prin-dop.html(.) www.sontek.com/princop/adp/adppo.htm(.) www.rdinstruments.com/products.html(.)"@en ;

These elements are the only radioisotopes that produce gamma rays of sufficient energy and intensity to be measured at airborne survey heights. This method is applicable to ground surveys and borehole logging.  The decay of radioisotopes and their daughters can be accompanied by gamma ray emissions.  Gamma ray spectrometers record gamma rays in counts per second (cps) or counts per minute (cpm).  The fully corrected count rates can be converted to mean ground level abundances of the radioelements.  The ground concentrations of count rates in the total count, potassium, uranium and thorium channels are given in nanograys per hour (NG/h), percent (%), parts per million (ppm) and parts per million (ppm) respectively."@en ;

    skos:scopeNote "All Gravimetric analyses rely on some final determination of weight as a means of quantifying an analyte. Since weight can be measured with greater accuracy than almost any other fundamental property, gravimetric analysis is potentially one of the most accurate classes of analytical methods available. These methods are among the oldest of analytical techniques, and they may be lengthy and tedious. Samples may have to be extensively treated to remove interfering substances. As a result, only a very few gravimetric methods are currently used in environmental analysis. There are four fundamental types of gravimetric analysis: physical gravimetry, thermogravimetry, precipitative gravimetric analysis, and electrodeposition. These differ in the preparation of the sample before weighing of the analyte. Physical gravimetry is the most common type used in environmental engineering. It involves the physical separation and classification of matter in environmental samples based on volatility and particle size (e.g., total suspended solids). With thermogravimetry, samples are heated and changes in sample mass are recorded. Volatile solids analysis is an important example of this type of gravimetric analysis. As the name implies, precipitative gravimetry relies on the chemical precipitation of an analyte. Its most important application in the environmental field is with the analysis of sulfite. Electrodeposition involves the electrochemical reduction of metal ions at a cathode, and simultaneous deposition of the ions on the cathode."@en ;

S1 represents any free hydrocarbons in the rock that either were present at the time of deposition or were generated from the kerogen since deposition. Heating to 300 deg C distills free hydrocarbons from organic matter (kerogen and bitumen) in the rock. The carboxyl groups in the kerogen break off between 300 and 390 deg C, yielding CO2.

The interaction between light absorbance and the sample is dependent on the wavelength of the light and the molecular structure of the sample. It is routinely used in the quantitative determination of solutions of transition metal ions and highly conjugated organic compounds. The Beer-Lambert law states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the solution''s concentration.
