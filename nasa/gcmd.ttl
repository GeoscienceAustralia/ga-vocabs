For many purposes a useful single parameter representing a given distribution is the volume median diameter, that is, that diameter for which the total volume of all drops having greater diameters is just equal to the total volume of all drops having smaller diameters.

these conditions, sea surface temperatures rise along the coast of\r
Peru and in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean and may remain high\r
for more than a year, having disastrous effects on marine life and\r
fishing. Excessive rainfall and flooding occur in the normally dry\r

Interacting parts of a single global system of climate\r
fluctuations. ENSO is the most prominent known source of interannual\r
variability in weather and climate around the world, though not all\r
areas are affected. The Southern Oscillation (SO) is a global-scale\r
seesaw in atmospheric pressure between Indonesia/North Australia, and\r
the southeast Pacific. In major warm events El Nino warming extends\r
over much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SO\r
pattern. Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are\r
developing countries with economies that are largely dependent upon\r
their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food\r
supply, employment, and foreign exchange. New capabilities to predict\r
the onset of ENSO event can have a global impact. While ENSO is a\r
natural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or\r
frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important\r
concern.\r

For example, suppose a 90 percent probability level for the spring season is computed to be March 1 at the 32 degree threshold. This means that nine years out of ten a temperature as cold or colder than 32 degrees is expected to occur later than March 1 during the spring season. For the fall season, the probability level represents the chance of having a temperature as cold or colder earlier than the computed date. The freeze-free probability level indicates the chance of having a longer freeze-free period than the computed number of days. The methods used to compute the freeze probabilities come from two data distributions: a discrete freeze or no-freeze distribution, where a no-freeze annual season is one in which only one or no freeze occurs; and a continuous one of freeze dates for the years of freeze occurrence, where"@en ;

For the case of a change in solar irradiance (i.e., \"solar forcing\"), the radiative forcing is simply the change in the average amount of solar energy absorbed per square meter of the Earth's area. Since the cross-sectional area of the Earth exposed to the sun (œÄr2) is equal to 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth (4œÄr2), the solar input per unit area is one quarter the change in solar intensity. This must be multiplied by the fraction of incident sunlight that is absorbed, F=(1-R), where R is the reflectivity, or albedo, of the Earth, equal to approximately 0.7.

Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key characteristics of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that they use or affect the climate system (e.g., atmosphere, land, or ocean) globally or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects that cross national boundaries.

20-to-30 years, while typical ENSO events persisted for 6 to 18\r
months; second, the climatic fingerprints of the PDO are most visible\r
in the North Pacific/North American sector, while secondary signatures\r

again from 1947-1976 while"warm" PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946\r

When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive.

Ideally, It is the total range of deviation at an instant of time from quiet day values of the horizontal magnetic field (h) around the auroral oval. Defined and developed by Davis and Sugiura [1966], AE has been usefully employed both qualitatively and quantitatively as a correlative index in studies of substorm morphology, the behavior of communication satellites, radio propagation, radio scintillation, and the coupling between the interplanetary magnetic field and the earth's magnetosphere. For these varied uses, AE possesses advantages over other geomagnetic indices or at least shares their advantageous properties."@en ;

Halons are used as fire extinguishing agents, both in built-in systems and in handheld portable fire extinguishers. Halon production in the U.S. ended on December 31, 1993, because they contribute to ozone depletion. They cause ozone depletion because they contain bromine. Bromine is many times more effective at destroying ozone than chlorine. At the time the current U.S. tax code was adopted, the ozone depletion potentials of halon 1301 and halon 1211 were observed to be 10 and 3, respectively. These values are used for tax calculations. Recent scientific studies, however, indicate that the ODPs are at least 12 and 6, respectively. Note: technically, all compounds containing carbon and fluorine and/or chlorine are halons, but in the context of the Clean Air Act, "halon" means a fire extinguishing agent as described above. A table of class I substances (http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/ods/classone.html) shows their ODPs, GWPs, and CAS numbers. Halons are numbered according to a standard scheme."""@en ;

infrared radiation. Atmospheric CO2 has increased about 25 percent since the
early 1800s, with an estimated increase of 10 percent since 1958 (burning
fossil fuels is the leading cause of increased CO2, deforestation the second
major cause). The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance the
greenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing to
the warming of Earth's lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory)\r
The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
for periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas
inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widely
accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate
that atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260¬ø280uL/L immediately before
industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the
preceding 10,000 years. \r
The longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has been
sampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 years
before the present. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration has varied between 180¬ø210 uL/L during ice ages, increasing to

Microfossils are a heterogeneous bunch of fossil remains studied as a single discipline because rock samples must be processed in certain ways to remove them and microscopes must be used to study them. Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. 

Microfossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation."""@en ;

This castellanus character is especially evident when the cloud is seen from the side. The cumuliform cloud elements generally have a common base and usually seem to be arranged in lines. The species is found only in the genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Cirrus castellanus differs from cirrocumulus castellanus in that its vertical protuberances subtend an angle of more than 1¬∞ when observed at an angle of more than 30¬∞ above the horizon. When altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus attain a considerable vertical development, they become cumulus congestus and often develop into cumulonimbus.

The feedback of the undisturbed process is comparably weak, however, because the local release leads to a warming spread over the whole globe.

The Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane.[1] Global warming may accelerate its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass.[2] Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as submarine clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming.[3][4] Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.[5]"""@en ;

One way to capture earth's record of that proxy data is to drill deep ice cores. Greenland, due to having a large and relatively stable deep ice sheet is often the target for drilling ice cores.

Isotopic analysis of the ice in the core can be linked to temperature and global sea level variations. Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.

While it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data. I attended a talk at ICCC 09 that showed one of the ice core operations had procedures that left significant contamination issues for CO2.

No matter what the nature of the vapor source (warm water, industrial combustion exhaust, exhaled breath), its equilibrium vapor pressure is greater than that corresponding to the colder air; thus, the water vapor, upon becoming mixed with and cooled by the cold air, rapidly condenses. It should be noted that this mechanism never allows the fog to actually reach the vapor source. Also, upon further mixing in sufficiently turbulent or convective flow (only a slight degree is needed), the fog particles evaporate at a more or less well defined upper limit of the fog. Note, also, that although advection of air is necessary to produce steam fog, it differs greatly from an advection fog in the usual sense, which is caused by warm, moist air moving over a cold surface. Steam fog is commonly observed over lakes and streams on cold autumn mornings as well as in polar regions. It is sometimes confused with ice fog, but its particles are entirely liquid. At temperatures below -29¬∞C (-20¬∞F), these may freeze into droxtals and create a type of ice fog that may be known as frost smoke."""@en ;

Particle pollution is made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles.

The size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. EPA is concerned about particles that are 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller because those are the particles that generally pass through the throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects. EPA groups particle pollution into two categories: 
<BR>
- "Inhalable coarse particles," such as those found near roadways and dusty industries, are larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter.
<BR>
- "Fine particles," such as those found in smoke and haze, are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles react in the air."""@en ;

(There's no mystery about that: just add up the six atoms.) In water carbonic acid dissociates rapidly to form a H+ ion and HCO2 (bicarbonate), so it affects the carbonate equilibrium, and pH values change as a result.
 
Dissolved CO2 lowers the average pH of rainwater to 5.7, even where "acid rain" caused by pollution isn't a factor. The gentle acidity of rainwater is a major source for the weathering of minerals, which the carbonic acid leaches from rocks and which eventually find their way to the ocean."""@en ;

    skos:definition """The East Atlantic (EA) pattern is the second prominent mode of low-frequency variability over the North Atlantic, and appears as a leading mode in all months. The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a ‚Äúsouthward shifted‚Äù NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).

The positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.

The EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004. The positive phase of the EA pattern was particularly strong and persistent during 1997-2004, when 3-month running mean values routinely averaged 1.0-2.0 standard deviations above normal."""@en ;

The Palmer Index is most effective in determining long term drought¬øa matter of several months¬øand is not as good with short-term forecasts (a matter of weeks). It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of minus numbers; for example, minus 2 is moderate drought, minus 3 is severe drought, and minus
4 is extreme drought. The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculating

The pattern consists of one primary anomaly center over the Gulf of Alaska and a separate anomaly center of opposite sign over the Hudson Bay. A weaker area of anomalies having similar sign to the Gulf of Alaska anomaly extends across Mexico and the extreme southeastern United States. This pattern reflects large-scale changes in both the location and eastward extent of the Pacific jet stream, and also in the strength and position of the climatological mean Hudson Bay Low.

A vulnerability index for the natural environment, the basis of all human welfare, has been developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and their partners. The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.

The reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country‚Äôs development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals."""@en ;

This is accomplished by applying different types of silvicultural treatments such as thinning, harvesting, planting, pruning, prescribed burning and site preparation. Intermediate treatments (thinning) are designed to enhance growth, quality, vigor, and composition of the stand after establishment or regeneration and prior to final harvest. Regeneration treatments (harvesting) are applied to mature stands in order to establish a new age class of trees. Regeneration methods are grouped into four categories: coppice, even-aged, two-aged, and uneven-aged.

All vegetation activities, including prescribed fire, wildlife habitat improvement, timber harvesting and cutting trees in campgrounds for human safety must have a silvicultural prescription. A silvicultural prescription is a document which has a planned series of treatments designed to change current stand structure and composition of a stand to one that meets management goals. The prescription normally considers ecological, economic, and societal objectives and constraints. In the Forest Service, silvicultural prescriptions are prepared or reviewed by a certified silviculturist prior to implementing the project or treatment."""@en ;

Noctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.

They are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees. 

Noctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.

One hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.

Subsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.

Noctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.

Competing anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.

They have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature &/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes."""@en ;

Thus, a strict radiation fog is a nighttime occurrence, although it may begin to form by evening twilight and often does not dissipate until after sunrise. Factors favoring the formation of radiation fog are 1) a shallow surface layer of relatively moist air beneath a dry layer and clear skies, and 2) light surface winds. It can be most confusing near sea coasts with cold coastal water. It can be difficult at times to differentiate between this and other types of fog, especially since nighttime cooling intensifies all fogs. Radiation fog is frequently and logically called ground fog, but in U.S. weather observing practice, the latter term is defined only with respect to the amount of sky that is obscured by the fog."""@en ;

PSCs form poleward of about 60¬∫S latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.

Type II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83¬∫C).

The Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8¬∫C above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.

Despite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude. The measurements are being used to investigate the climatology of the clouds and their relation to the temperature structure of the stratosphere, and the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and planetary waves in modulating their structure and ozone depletion."""@en ;

Depending on the temperature of evaporation and how far the water has had to travel before it fell as snow, the ratio of 18O to 16O will vary. This ratio, known as d18O, can be measured very accurately using a mass spectrometer. Over short time scales the change in temperature from summer to winter produces a very clear oscillation in the 18O/16O ratio. This oscillation is used to determine the age of the core at different depths, simply by counting the oscillations. Over longer time periods, this ratio indicates the average temperature of the regions between the evaporation site and the coring site.

NINO3.4 is the average sea surface temperature anomaly in the region bounded by 5¬∞N to 5¬∞S, from 170¬∞W to 120¬∞W. This region has large variability on El Ni√±o time scales, and is close to the region where changes in local sea-surface temperature are important for shifting the large region of rainfall typically located in the far western Pacific.

Because charcoal particles can be carried aloft to great heights and transported great distances, the source of the charcoal may be from distant fires as well as local fires. Charcoal accumulation may continue for a few years after a fire because of transportation and redeposition of secondary charcoal. This process tends to blur the exact age of a fire, even when the charcoal particles are directly dated by radiocarbon dating, which itself has a dating precision of +/- 5%. Additionally, the charcoal deposited may represent more than one fire within the area, or fires from more than one year. As a result, fire episodes are referred to as one or more fires occurring in the time interval of interest, rather than individual fires."@en ;

The index allowed measurements of the frequency and extent to which variables exceeded their respective WHO guidelines, at each individual monitoring station included within GEMStat, allowing both spatial and temporal assessment of global water quality.

Interpretation of this record reveals a diverse array of environmental signatures that include the documentation of anthropogenically derived pollutants, volcanic and biomass burning events, storminess over marine surfaces, continental aridity and biogenic source strength plus information related to the controls on both high- and low-frequency climate events of the last 110,000 years. Climate forcings investigated include changes in insolation of the order of the major orbital cycles that control the long-term behavior of atmospheric circulation patterns through changes in ice volume (sea level), events such as the Heinrich events (massive discharges of icebergs first identified in t he marine record) that are found to operate on a 6100-year cycle due largely to the lagged response of ice sheets to changes in insolation and consequent glacier dynamics, and rapid climate change events (massive reorganizations of atmospheric circulation) that are demonstrated to operate on 1450-year cycles. Changes in insolation and associated positive feedbacks related to ice sheets may assist in explaining favorable time periods and controls on the amplitude of massive rapid climate change events. Explanation for the exact timing and global synchroneity of these events is, however, more complicated. Preliminary evidence points to possible solar variability-climate associations for these events and perhaps others that are embedded in our ice-core-derived atmospheric circulation records."@en ;

    skos:definition """Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was discovered by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm\r
Scheele in 1782, who prepared it from the pigment Prussian blue (hence its\r
other name of prussic acid). <p>\r
There are many naturally occurring substances yielding cyanide in certain\r
seeds, such as the pit of the wild cherry. It usually occurs in combination\r
with plant sugars. The tuberous edible plant of the spurge family called\r
cassava (also known as manioc, mandioc, or yuca) was used by primitive peoples\r
to produce HCN for poison darts and arrows. HCN is produced by other plants,\r
bacteria and fungi. Emissions from CN radicals are occasionally observed from\r
lightning disturbed air. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by biomass burning since\r
nitrogen in plant material is mostly present as amino acids and upon combustion
this nitrogen is emitted as a variety of compounds including NH3, NO, NO2, N2O,
organic nitriles and nitrates. It is interesting to note that the atmospheric\r
measurements of HCN reported by Zander et al. (1988) gave a mixing ratio for\r
HCN in the Southern Hemisphere which was approximately 5% higher than that for\r
the Northern Hemisphere. This may be due to biomass burning.\r
There are many anthropogenic sources of compounds containing CN which can be\r
released into the atmosphere. Cyanides are used in a variety of chemical\r
processes including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel,\r
electroplating and in the concentration of ores. Hydrogen cyanide is used to\r
prepare polyacrylonitrile fibres (known by the generic name of acrylic)\r
synthetic rubber, plastics, and in gas masers to produce a wavelength of 3.34\r
mm. Hydrogen cyanide is a combustion product which is a human hazard during\r
domestic and industrial fires and from tobacco smoking. Some catalytic\r
converters in bad repair can produce large amounts of Hydrogen cyanide.\r
Hydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities for laboratory and commercial\r
use by three principle methods: Treatment of sodium cyanide with sulphuric\r
acid, catalytic oxidation of a methane-ammonia mixture, and decomposition of\r
formamide (HCONH2)."""@en ;

they are made of, for example snow, ice, rock or soil avalanches. A mixture of
these would be called a debris avalanche.  <br><br>\r
A large avalanche can run for miles, and can create massive destruction of the 
lower forest and anything else in its path. Avalanches occur when the load on
the upper snow layers exceeds bonding forces (bonding to layer beneath, support
from anchors such as rocks and trees, stress support from top or bottom of
slope). Critical load may be exceeded naturally by adding new snow or by rapid 
loading, by falling ice, cornices and similar means. The bonding forces within 
a snowpack are affected by temperatures (e.g., a lubricated melt layer, or a
fragile crystal layer) before, during and after snowfall. Avalanches are also \r
triggered by humans - because of the additional weight, kicks during skiing \r
(e.g. during jumps) or intentionally by explosives, slope-cuts and other means.

Atmospheric CO2 has increased about 25 percent since the early 1800s, with an estimated increase of 10 percent since 1958 (burning fossil fuels is the leading cause of increased CO2, deforestation the second
major cause). The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance the greenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing to the warming of Earth's lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory) The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
for periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260¬ø280uL/L immediately before
industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 years.
The longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 years before the present. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180¬ø210 uL/L during ice ages, increasing to
280¬ø300 uL/L during warmer interglacials.(http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Carbon-dioxide)"""@en ;

zone, and its effect on fisheries. It is becoming a highly visible hot
topic in the Gulf of Mexico and other regions as the onset of hypoxia is
largely due to increased nutrient run off from agriculture practices in the

During winter and spring, the pattern consists of a north-south dipole of anomalies, with one center located over the Kamchatka Peninsula and another broad center of opposite sign covering portions of southeastern Asia and the low latitudes of the extreme western North Pacific. Therefore, strong positive or negative phases of this pattern reflect pronounced zonal and meridional variations in the location and intensity of the entrance region of the Pacific (or East Asian) jet steam. 

In the summer and fall, the WP pattern becomes increasingly wave-like, and a third prominent center appears over Alaska and the Beaufort Sea, with a sign opposite to the center over the western North Pacific. This wave structure is most evident in the Fall, when it extends downstream along a quasi great-circle route into the western United States.

(There's no mystery about that: just add up the six atoms.) In water carbonic acid dissociates rapidly to form a H+ ion and HCO2 (bicarbonate), so it affects the carbonate equilibrium, and pH values change as a result.
 
Dissolved CO2 lowers the average pH of rainwater to 5.7, even where "acid rain" caused by pollution isn't a factor. The gentle acidity of rainwater is a major source for the weathering of minerals, which the carbonic acid leaches from rocks and which eventually find their way to the ocean."""@en ;

(AGCM) coupled to an Ocean general circulation models (OGCM). With the addition
of other components (such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration
over land), the AOGCM becomes the basis for a full climate model. \r
Some recent models include the biosphere, carbon cycle and atmospheric
chemistry as well. AOGCMs can be used for the prediction and rate of change of
future climate. They are also used to study the variability and physical
processes of the coupled climate system. Global climate models typically have a
resolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate projections from the Hadley
Centre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its successor
HadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have
usually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but
if a carbon cycle model is included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon
dioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere. Similarly, an AOGCM coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is
able to predict the changes in concentration of other atmospheric constituents
in response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases.
Further information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3
(thermohaline circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability
in the ocean of HadCM3.\r

However, little data on the most important aeolian dust-derived biological micronutrient, iron (Fe), has so far been available from ice-cores from Greenland or Antarctica. Furthermore, Fe deposition reconstructions derived from the palaeoproxies particulate dust and calcium differ significantly from the Fe flux data available. The ability to measure high temporal resolution Fe data in polar ice-cores is crucial for the study of the timing and magnitude of relationships between geochemical events and biological responses in the open ocean. This work adapts an existing flow injection analysis (FIA) methodology for low-level trace Fe determinations with an existing glaciochemical analysis system, continuous flow analysis (CFA) of ice-cores. Fe-induced oxidation of N,N'-dimethyl-p-pheylenediamine (DPD) is used to quantify the biologically more important and easily leachable Fe fraction released in a controlled digestion step at pH ~1.0. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of labile Fe in ice-core samples collected from the Antarctic Byrd ice-core and the Greenland Ice-Core Project (GRIP) ice-core."@en ;

These regions capture the largest precipitation anomalies associated with the interannual variations of the Walker circulation and contain the largest correlations between GPCP and Nino 3.4 and SOI. Within P and MC the absolute magnitude of the largest correlation is over +0.6. 

Because of the spatially varying nature of rainfall, it was decided to use a moving block average which would capture the strongest zonal gradients within the equatorial Pacific.

    skos:definition """In cloud physics, the merging of two water drops into a single larger drop after collision.

Coalescence between colliding drops is affected by the impact energy, which tends to increase with the higher fall velocities of larger drops. Colliding drops having negligible impact energy compared to their surface energy behave as water spheres that collide with a collision efficiency (the fraction of small drops that collide with a large drop within the geometric collision cross section) predicted by the theory for falling spheres. The result of increasing impact energy is to flatten the colliding drops at the point of impact, impeding the drainage of the air and delaying contact between them. As the distortion relaxes, the drops rebound, reducing the coalescence efficiency for cloud drops and drizzle drops colliding with smaller drops. At larger impact energy, separation will occur if the rotational energy (fixed by conservation of angular momentum) is higher than the surface energy of the coalescing drops. This phenomenon, termed temporary coalescence, can result in satellite droplets considerably smaller than either of the parent drops. This phenomenon is also called partial coalescence because the large drop may gain mass as a result of the higher internal pressure in the small drop. At still larger impact energy, drop breakup occurs for the smaller drop. About 20% of the high-energy collisions between large raindrops (d > 3 mm) and drizzle drops (d > 0.2 mm) result in the disintegration of both drops. Other factors that affect coalescence are electric charge and electric field, both of which promote coalescence, leading to earlier onset of coalescence during an interaction so that coalescence efficiencies are increased by suppression of rebound and temporary coalescence. All of these processes are important in formation of precipitation in all liquid clouds both above and below 0¬∞C."""@en ;

Degree days are the difference between the daily temperature mean, (high temperature plus low temperature divided by two) and 65¬∞F. If the temperature mean is above 65¬∞F, we subtract 65 from the mean and the result is Cooling Degree Days. If the temperature mean is below 65¬∞F, we subtract the mean from 65 and the result is Heating Degree Days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1: The high temperature for a particular day was 90¬∞F and the low temperature was 66¬∞F. The temperature mean for that day was:

( 90¬∞F + 66¬∞F ) / 2 = 78¬∞F

Because the result is above 65¬∞F:
78¬∞F - 65¬∞F = 13 Cooling Degree Days


Example 2: The high temperature for a particular day was 33¬∞F and the low temperature was 25¬∞F. The temperature mean for that day was:

( 33¬∞F + 25¬∞F ) / 2 = 29¬∞F

Because the result is below 65¬∞F:

65¬∞F - 29¬∞F = 36 Heating Degree Days.

Nevertheless, unavoidable leakage in the production, distribution, storage and consumption of H2 could drastically alter the mixing ratio of H2 in the atmosphere. Although it is not a greenhouse gas itself, H2 affects the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane and many other species via its reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical (Schultz et al.,2003). In addition, H2 is an important source for stratospheric water vapor, which provides the substrate for polar stratospheric clouds that play a key role in the formation of the stratospheric polar ozone hole. Therefore, increasing levels of H2 in the atmosphere will counteract the predicted recovery of the ozone hole (Tromp et al., 2003; Warwick et al.,2004; Feck et al., 2008)."@en ;

The protuberances of its upper portion have begun to lose their cumuliform outline; they loom and usually flatten, then transform into a whitish mass with more or less diffuse outlines and vertical striations.

By convention, the name cumulonimbus calvus is given to any highly developed cumuliform cloud that produces lightning, thunder, or hail, although the top shows no obvious trace of transformation into ice.

    skos:definition "The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered equivalent to the quantity with standard name sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical concept of a \"bulk\" sea surface temperature considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, \"bulk\" sea surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a more precise, well defined quantity than \"bulk\" sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the mixed layer temperature. The temperature of sea water at a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable."@en ;

Calculation Method:
The AMM spatial pattern is defined via applying Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to sea surface temperature (SST; left field) and the zonal and meridional components of the 10m wind field (right field) over the time period 1950-2005, from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. To define the spatial pattern, data are defined over the region (21S-32N, 74W-15E), and spatially smoothed (three longitude by two latitude points). The seasonal cycle is removed, data are detrended, a three-month running mean is applied to the data, and the linear fit to the Cold Tongue Index (a measure of ENSO variability) is subtracted from each spatial point. Spatial patterns are defined as the first left (SST) and right (winds) maps resulting from singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields. The AMM time series below is calculated via projecting SST or the 10m wind field (detrended, CTI removed, but no 3-month running mean) onto the spatial structure resulting from the MCA above.

The components of the cryosphere play an important role in the Earth‚Äôs climate. Snow and ice reflect heat from the sun, helping to regulate our planet‚Äôs temperature.

Degree days are the difference between the daily temperature mean, (high temperature plus low temperature divided by two) and 65¬∞F. If the temperature mean is above 65¬∞F, we subtract 65 from the mean and the result is Cooling Degree Days. If the temperature mean is below 65¬∞F, we subtract the mean from 65 and the result is Heating Degree Days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1: The high temperature for a particular day was 90¬∞F and the low temperature was 66¬∞F. The temperature mean for that day was:

( 90¬∞F + 66¬∞F ) / 2 = 78¬∞F

Because the result is above 65¬∞F:
78¬∞F - 65¬∞F = 13 Cooling Degree Days


Example 2: The high temperature for a particular day was 33¬∞F and the low temperature was 25¬∞F. The temperature mean for that day was:

( 33¬∞F + 25¬∞F ) / 2 = 29¬∞F

Because the result is below 65¬∞F:

    skos:definition "The electrical nature of a material is characterized by its conductivity (or, inversely, its resistivity) and its dielectric constant, and coefficients that indicate the rates of change of these with temperature, frequency at which measurement is made, and so on. For rocks with a range of chemical composition as well as variable physical properties of porosity and fluid content, the values of electrical properties can vary widely."@en ;
